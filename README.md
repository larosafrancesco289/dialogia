### Setup

Create `/.env.local`. Recommended proxy mode (keeps keys on the server):

```
# Route OpenRouter via Next.js API with server key
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_OR_PROXY=true
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1_your_server_key_here

# Optional: Brave Search (server-side only)
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=brave_your_key_here

# Optional: default ZDR behavior (false if unset)
# Uncomment to start in ZDR-only mode
# NEXT_PUBLIC_OR_ZDR_ONLY_DEFAULT=true

# Optional: default OpenRouter route preference (speed|cost; defaults to speed)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_OR_ROUTE_PREFERENCE_DEFAULT=cost

# Optional: direct Anthropic access (pick one)
# Direct client key (not recommended for production)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-live_your_client_key_here

# Or proxy via Next.js API with a server key
# NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_ANTHROPIC_PROXY=true
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-live_your_server_key_here
```

Private access gate (optional but recommended when sharing preview):

```
# Signed cookie for access sessions
AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET=replace-with-strong-random-hex

# HMAC pepper for access codes
ACCESS_CODE_PEPPER=replace-with-strong-random-hex

# Comma-separated HMAC-SHA256(code, ACCESS_CODE_PEPPER) hex digests
ACCESS_CODES_HASHED=
```

Client-side mode (not recommended):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1_your_client_key_here
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant_your_client_key_here
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Run

- Dev server: `npm run dev` ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- Build: `npm run build`
- Start (prod): `npm start`
- Format: `npm run format`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Type check: `npm run lint:types`
- Tests: `npm run test`

Wrappers are also available: `scripts/dev.sh`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/start.sh`.

### Usage

- Pick a model in the top header. Favorites and hide actions personalize the list.
- Compose and send with Enter; Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
- Attachments:
  - Images: shown inline when the model supports vision.
  - Audio (mp3/wav): sent as input_audio content to audio-capable models.
  - PDFs: sent as OpenRouter file blocks (parsed downstream; no local OCR).
- Reasoning: toggle effort in the composer for thinking models; view ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù panel per message.
- Web search: toggle the search icon to ground the next reply with sources. Brave runs locally when enabled; otherwise the OpenRouter web plugin is attached.
- DeepResearch UI: click the beaker icon in the composer to run multi-step web research on the current input. Results appear as an assistant message with a sources panel.
- Compare: click the grid icon in the header to run a prompt across multiple models and review metrics.
- Slash commands:
  - `/model <id|name>` ‚Äî set the model.
  - `/search on|off|toggle` ‚Äî toggle Brave web search.
  - `/reasoning none|low|medium|high` ‚Äî set reasoning effort.
  - `/help` ‚Äî list supported commands.

### Tutor Mode: Adaptive Learning Plans

Dialogia includes an experimental **Tutor Mode** that provides personalized, structured learning experiences with automatic progress tracking.

#### Features

- **Automatic Plan Generation**: Start a chat with a learning goal (e.g., "I want to learn Python basics"), and the tutor automatically generates a structured learning plan with topics, prerequisites, and learning objectives.
- **Mastery Tracking**: The system continuously monitors your understanding through conversation, tracking confidence levels (0-100%) for each topic based on your responses, questions, and demonstrated knowledge.
- **Adaptive Progression**: The tutor automatically advances you to the next topic when you reach 70% mastery, have completed 5+ interactions, and show no unresolved misconceptions.
- **Visual Progress**: View your learning plan and progress in real-time through the plan sidebar, with color-coded indicators showing completed, in-progress, and upcoming topics.

#### How to Use

1. **Enable Tutor Mode**: Click the "Tutor" button in the top header to activate tutor mode for the current chat (or for the next new chat if no chat is open).

2. **Start Learning**: Begin a conversation with your learning goal, for example:
   - "I want to learn React hooks"
   - "Teach me linear algebra fundamentals"
   - "Help me understand how Docker works"
   - "I need to learn SQL for data analysis"

3. **View Your Plan**: Once the plan is generated, you'll see:
   - A **progress indicator** in the header showing your completion percentage
   - The **current focus topic** highlighted in the header and composer
   - A **"View Plan" button** to open the full learning plan sidebar

4. **Track Your Progress**: As you learn:
   - Your mastery level for each topic is displayed in **assistant messages** after key interactions
   - **Status changes** (topic completion, transitions) appear as notifications in messages
   - The **plan sidebar** updates in real-time with your current mastery levels
   - Topics automatically unlock as you complete prerequisites

5. **Navigate Your Plan**: Click "View Plan" to:
   - See all topics in your learning path
   - View prerequisites and dependencies
   - Check your mastery level for each topic (with progress bars)
   - Manually advance or revisit topics if needed
   - See estimated completion time and difficulty

#### Example Learning Goals

Tutor mode works best with structured, skill-based learning goals:

**Programming Languages:**
- "I want to learn Python basics"
- "Teach me JavaScript ES6+ features"
- "Help me understand TypeScript type system"

**Frameworks & Tools:**
- "I need to learn React for web development"
- "Teach me Docker containerization"
- "Help me understand Git workflows"

**Concepts & Theory:**
- "I want to learn linear algebra"
- "Teach me database normalization"
- "Help me understand machine learning fundamentals"

**Professional Skills:**
- "I need to learn SQL for data analysis"
- "Teach me REST API design principles"
- "Help me understand system design concepts"

#### Understanding the Learner Model

The tutor tracks your mastery using a Bayesian confidence model:
- **Starting confidence**: 30% (beginner level)
- **Evidence weights**: -0.5 (misconception) to +0.5 (clear understanding)
- **Completion threshold**: 70% confidence, 5+ interactions, no unresolved misconceptions
- **Update frequency**: Learner model updates every 3 interactions by default

Progress indicators use color coding:
- üü¢ **Green (70-100%)**: Strong mastery, ready to advance
- üü° **Yellow (40-69%)**: Developing understanding, keep practicing
- üî¥ **Red (0-39%)**: Needs more work, concepts not yet clear

#### Tips for Effective Learning

- **Be specific** with your learning goals ‚Äî the more focused, the better the plan
- **Ask questions** when you don't understand ‚Äî the tutor tracks misconceptions
- **Demonstrate understanding** by explaining concepts back or solving problems
- **Review the plan** regularly to see your overall progress and upcoming topics
- **Take your time** ‚Äî mastery is based on understanding, not speed

#### Limitations & Known Issues

- Plan generation requires a capable model (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Very broad goals (e.g., "teach me everything") may produce less structured plans
- Mastery tracking is based on conversational evidence, not formal assessments
- Manual topic advancement is available but may skip important prerequisites

### Architecture

- Framework: Next.js App Router (React 18)
- State: Zustand with local persistence; Dexie for IndexedDB tables
- API proxy: `/api/openrouter/*` for models/completions; `/api/brave` for web search
- Markdown: `react-markdown` + GFM, Prism, KaTeX, Mermaid
- Styles: Tailwind v4 base + `styles/francesco-bootstrap.css` tokens; `app/globals.css` layout
- Agent services: `src/lib/agent/request.ts`, `searchFlow.ts`, and `tutorFlow.ts` centralize request building, web search orchestration, and tutor memory composition for slices.
- Capabilities: Derived from OpenRouter model metadata (vision, audio input, image output, reasoning)
- PDFs: Routed with OpenRouter‚Äôs file parser plugin ‚Äî no local parsing required

Security notes:

- Prefer proxy mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_OR_PROXY=true`) to keep provider keys server-side.
- Avoid placing secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars when possible.
- Brave Search runs only server-side and requires `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
- ZDR-only: Opt-in via Settings or `NEXT_PUBLIC_OR_ZDR_ONLY_DEFAULT=true`.
- Access gate: Middleware validates a signed, HttpOnly cookie on every request; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/access`. Add env vars above and distribute plaintext codes privately.

### Deploying on Vercel

- Create a release branch (e.g., `release`) and point your Vercel project‚Äôs Production Branch to it.
- Add the env vars from Setup to the Vercel project (Production). Redeploy.
- No client-side keys required; all model calls run through `/api/openrouter/*` with the server-side key.

### Project Structure

```
app/                    # Next.js App Router entry (layout, page, globals)
src/components/         # React components (PascalCase .tsx)
src/components/message/ # Message subcomponents (meta, reasoning, sources)
src/components/settings/# Settings drawer panels per tab (models/chat/tutor/etc.)
src/lib/                # Utilities, API client, state slices
src/data/               # Curated model metadata
src/types/              # Type augmentations
public/                 # Static assets served by Next
assets/                 # Screenshots
styles/                 # Global CSS tokens (francesco-bootstrap.css)
scripts/                # Helper scripts (dev/build/start)
tests/                  # Legacy Node-based unit tests (`npm run test` also runs colocated *.test.ts)
```

### Development

- Language: TypeScript + React 18; Next.js App Router
- Formatting: Prettier (`.prettierrc`) ‚Äî single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas=all, width=100
- Naming: PascalCase components in `src/components/`; named exports favored
- Linting & types: run `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:types` before pushing
- Testing: `npm run test` (Node test runner via `tsx`); add colocated `*.test.ts(x)` for unit coverage.
